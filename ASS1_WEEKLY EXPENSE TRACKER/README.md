ASS1 — WEEKLY EXPENSE TRACKER

📌 Project Overview

The Weekly Expense Tracker is a C programming project developed as part of my Foundation Computing studies at Solent University.

The project demonstrates the progressive development of a simple expense-tracking program through four assessment grades: Grade D, Grade C, Grade B and Grade A.

The program develops from a basic fixed-value expense calculator into a more flexible system that allows users to enter spending categories, record expenses for two weeks, calculate totals and daily averages, validate inputs, compare individual categories, and provide an overall spending summary.

🎯 Project Objectives

The main objectives of the project were to:

Develop a working expense-tracking program using C.
Apply fundamental programming concepts to a practical problem.
Calculate weekly spending totals.
Calculate daily average spending.
Accept and process user input.
Validate user-entered expense values.
Compare spending against a defined budget.
Compare spending between two weeks.
Compare individual spending categories.
Produce clear and structured output.
📈 Project Development

The project was developed progressively through four grades.

Grade D — Basic Expense Calculation

Grade D represents the starting point of the project.

The program uses fixed values embedded directly within the code for:

Food
Transport
Entertainment
It then calculates the total weekly spending.

Example:

Food: £15000 Transport: £8000 Entertainment: £5000

Total Weekly Spending: £28000

Concepts demonstrated

Variable declaration
Integer data types
Arithmetic calculations
Fixed values
"printf()" output
Grade C — User Input, Validation and Budget Comparison

Grade C introduces user interaction.

The user enters expenses for:

Food
Transport
Entertainment
The program then:

Accepts user input using "scanf()".
Validates the entered values.
Rejects negative spending values.
Calculates total weekly spending.
Calculates the daily average.
Compares the total against a £40,000 budget.
Validation

If a negative expense is entered, the program displays:

Invalid Input! Spending cannot be negative. Try again!

Budget comparison

The program determines whether spending is:

Within Budget

or:

Over Budget

Concepts demonstrated

User input
"scanf()"
"if" / "else"
Input validation
Arithmetic calculations
Floating-point calculations
Budget comparison
Online Program

The Grade C program was also tested using the Programiz online C compiler.

Grade B — Two-Week Expense Tracking

Grade B extends the Grade C program by introducing two weeks of expense data.

The user enters:

Week 1

Food
Transport
Entertainment
Week 2

Food
Transport
Entertainment
The program then calculates:

Week 1 total spending
Week 1 daily average
Week 2 total spending
Week 2 daily average
It also compares the two weekly totals.

The final status can be:

Your Spending INCREASED

Your Spending DECREASED

or:

Your Spending REMAINED THE SAME

Validation

Grade B retains validation to prevent negative expense values.

Concepts demonstrated

Multiple sets of user input
Variables
"scanf()"
Input validation
"if" / "else if" / "else"
Arithmetic calculations
Weekly comparison
Daily average calculation
Structured output
Online Program

The Grade B program was tested using the Programiz online C compiler.

Grade A — Dynamic Weekly Expense Tracker

Grade A represents the most developed version of the project.

Instead of limiting the program to three predefined categories, the user can choose the number of spending categories they want to track, up to a maximum of 10 categories.

The user then enters:

The category names
Week 1 expenses
Week 2 expenses
The program processes the information and produces detailed reports.

Grade A Features

Dynamic Category Selection
The user chooses the number of categories to track.

How many spending categories do you want to track (Maximum 10):

Category Names
The user can create their own categories, such as:

Food Data Water Gas

Two-Week Expense Recording
The program records spending separately for:

Week 1
Week 2
Expense Validation
The program checks for negative expense values and terminates the input process if invalid spending is entered.

Weekly Totals
The program calculates the total spending for each week.

Daily Averages
The daily average is calculated by dividing the weekly total by seven:

Daily Average = Weekly Total / 7.0

Category Comparison
Each category is compared between Week 1 and Week 2.

The result can be:

Increased
Decreased
Stayed the Same
Overall Spending Comparison
The program compares the total spending for both weeks and reports whether overall spending:

Increased
Decreased
Stayed the Same
🧠 Programming Concepts Demonstrated

Across Grades D–A, the project demonstrates the following C programming concepts:

Standard input/output using "stdio.h"
"printf()"
"scanf()"
Variables
Integer data types
Floating-point data types
Character arrays
Two-dimensional arrays
Constants using "#define"
Arithmetic operations
"for" loops
"if" statements
"else if"
"else"
User input
Input validation
Conditional decision making
Arrays
Iteration
Calculations
Formatted output

The "source-code" folder contains the four stages of the assessment.

The "screenshots", "test-results" and "demonstration" folders are reserved for supporting project evidence.

🧪 Testing and Validation

Testing was incorporated throughout the development of the project.

Examples include:

Valid Input

The program accepts valid positive expense values and calculates the required totals and averages.

Negative Input

Negative expense values are rejected with an appropriate validation message:

Invalid Input! Spending cannot be negative. Try again!

Budget Testing

Grade C includes a budget comparison using a defined budget of:

£40,000

The program determines whether spending is within or over the budget.

Two-Week Comparison

Grade B compares the Week 1 and Week 2 totals and reports whether spending increased, decreased or remained the same.

Category Comparison

Grade A compares individual categories between the two weeks.

Detailed screenshots and test evidence will be stored in the corresponding project folders.

📊 Example Grade A Scenario

A user could select four categories:

Food Data Water Gas

For example:

Week 1 Food: £12000 Data: £9000 Water: £8000 Gas: £7

and:

Week 2 Food: £2000 Data: £5000 Water: £1000 Gas: £2000

The program calculates the totals and daily averages and then compares each category.

It can subsequently produce an overall result such as:

Week 1 Total : £29007 Week 2 Total : £10000

Overall Spending Decreased.

💡 Learning Outcome

This project provided practical experience in developing a C program from a simple fixed-value implementation into a more flexible user-driven application.
