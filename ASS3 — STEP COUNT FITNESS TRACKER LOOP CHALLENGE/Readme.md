ASS3 — STEP COUNT FITNESS TRACKER LOOP CHALLENGE

📌 Project Overview

The Step Count Fitness Tracker Loop Challenge is a C programming project developed as part of my Foundation Computing studies at Solent University.

The project demonstrates the progressive development of a fitness tracking application through four assessment grades: Grade D, Grade C, Grade B and Grade A.

The system develops from a basic one-day step calculator into a multi-day fitness tracker capable of recording different forms of activity input, calculating distance and calories, monitoring daily goal progress, applying activity-intensity factors, maintaining running totals and tracking goal-achievement streaks.

📈 Project Development

The project was developed progressively through four grades.

---

Grade D — Daily Step Calculation

Grade D represents the basic foundation of the Step Count Fitness Tracker.

The program asks the user to enter the number of steps completed in one day.

The entered steps are then converted into:

- Distance walked in kilometres.
- Estimated calories burned.

Conversion Rates

The program uses the following fixed conversion rates:

1 kilometre = 1,250 steps

1,000 steps = 40 calories

Calculations

Distance:

Kilometres = Steps ÷ 1,250

Calories:

Calories = (Steps ÷ 1,000) × 40

The results are displayed to 2 decimal places.

Example

For 8,000 steps:

Distance Walked : 6.00 km
Calories Burned : 320.00 kcal

Concepts Demonstrated

- Variable declaration
- Integer data types
- Floating-point data types
- User input using "scanf()"
- Output using "printf()"
- Arithmetic calculations
- Unit conversion
- Formatted decimal output

Online Program

The Grade D program was developed/tested using the Programiz online C compiler.

Grade C — Multi-Day Fitness Tracking

Grade C extends the system by introducing loop-based multi-day tracking.

Instead of processing only one day's activity, the program allows the user to repeatedly enter daily step counts.

After each entry, the program calculates and displays:

- Distance for the day.
- Calories burned for the day.

The user is then asked whether another day should be added.

Add another day? (y/n):

Running Totals

The program maintains running totals for:

- Total steps.
- Total kilometres.
- Total calories.
- Number of days tracked.

When the user chooses to stop, the program produces a final fitness tracker summary.

Example

=====================================
      FITNESS TRACKER SUMMARY
=====================================
Days Tracked      : 2
Total Steps       : 15000
Total Distance    : 12.00 km
Total Calories    : 600.00 kcal

Concepts Demonstrated

- "do...while" loops
- Repeated user input
- Running totals
- Counters
- Character input
- Conditional loop control
- Arithmetic calculations
- Daily and overall summaries

Online Program

The Grade C program was developed/tested using the Programiz online C compiler.

Grade B — Multiple Activity Input Methods

Grade B further develops the fitness tracker by allowing the user to choose how activity information is entered.

Activity Menu

The user can select:

1. Steps
2. Kilometres
3. Walking Minutes

This allows activity to be entered as:

- Number of steps.
- Distance in kilometres.
- Walking duration in minutes.

Conversion Rates

The system converts all activity inputs into an equivalent step count.

1 kilometre = 1,250 steps

1 walking minute = 100 steps

1,000 steps = 40 calories

Therefore, regardless of how the user enters the activity, the program can calculate:

- Total steps.
- Total distance.
- Total calories.

Entry Tracking

The program also records how many entries were made using each method:

Steps
Kilometres
Walking Minutes

Example

A user enters:

3 kilometres
30 walking minutes

The program converts these activities into:

Total Steps        : 6750
Total Distance     : 5.40 km
Total Calories     : 270.00 kcal

The system then reports the number of entries recorded through each input method.

Concepts Demonstrated

- Menu selection
- "switch" / "case"
- "do...while" loops
- Multiple input methods
- Unit conversion
- Running totals
- Entry counters
- Conditional logic
- Input validation
- Repeated activity tracking

Online Program

The Grade B program was developed/tested using the Programiz online C compiler.

Grade A — Advanced Fitness Tracker

Grade A represents the most developed version of the Step Count Fitness Tracker.

The program introduces a daily step goal, goal-progress tracking, activity intensity, multi-day tracking, input validation, daily summaries, overall statistics and goal-achievement streak tracking.

---

🎯 Daily Step Goal

When the program starts, the user sets a daily step goal.

For example:

Enter your daily step goal: 8000

The goal is then used to measure the user's progress on each tracked day.

---

📊 Goal Progress

After each day's activity is entered, the program calculates the percentage of the daily goal achieved.

The calculation is:

Progress = (Today's Steps ÷ Daily Goal) × 100

For example:

Today's Steps = 7,500
Daily Goal    = 8,000

Progress = (7,500 ÷ 8,000) × 100
          = 93.75%

The program then determines whether the goal was achieved.

Goal Progress       : 93.75%
Goal Not Achieved.

If the progress reaches or exceeds 100%, the program displays:

Goal Achieved!

---

🚶 Activity Intensity

Grade A introduces an activity-intensity factor that affects estimated calories burned.

The user can select:

L = Light
M = Moderate
F = Fast

The intensity is then incorporated into the calorie calculation.

Intensity Factors

- Light: 10% reduction from the base calorie estimate.
- Moderate: Base calorie estimate.
- Fast: 20% increase from the base calorie estimate.

This demonstrates how conditional logic can modify a calculated value according to user-selected activity intensity.

---

🔄 Multi-Day Tracking

The Grade A system allows fitness activity to be recorded across multiple days.

For each day, the program records:

- Steps.
- Distance.
- Calories burned.
- Goal progress.
- Goal achievement status.

The user can continue entering additional days:

Track another day? (y/n):

The program continues until the user chooses to stop.

---

🛡️ Input Validation

Grade A includes validation for the major user inputs.

The program validates:

- Daily step goal.
- Daily step count.
- Activity intensity.
- Continue/stop responses.

Invalid values cause the program to display an appropriate message and re-prompt the user until valid information is supplied.

Examples include:

Daily goal must be greater than 0.

Steps cannot be negative.

Invalid intensity! Please enter L, M or F.

This improves the reliability and usability of the program.

---

📋 Daily Summary

After each day's activity is processed, the program displays a daily activity summary containing:

- Total steps.
- Distance travelled.
- Calories burned.
- Percentage of the daily goal achieved.
- Goal achievement status.

Example:

========== DAILY SUMMARY ==========
Steps               : 7500
Distance            : 6.00 km
Calories Burned     : 300.00 kcal
Goal Progress       : 93.75%
Goal Not Achieved.

---

📊 Overall Fitness Report

When the user finishes tracking, the program displays an overall fitness report.

The report contains:

- Number of days tracked.
- Total steps across all days.
- Total distance across all days.
- Total calories burned.
- Average steps per day.
- Average distance per day.
- Average calories per day.
- Longest goal-achievement streak.

Example:

=========================================
        FITNESS TRACKER REPORT
=========================================
Days Tracked        : 1
Total Steps         : 7500
Total Distance      : 6.00 km
Total Calories      : 300.00 kcal
Average Steps       : 7500.00
Average Distance    : 6.00 km
Average Calories    : 300.00 kcal
Longest Goal Streak : 0 Day(s)

---

🔥 Goal Streak Tracking

The Grade A program tracks consecutive days on which the user meets or exceeds the daily step goal.

If:

Today's Steps >= Daily Goal

the current streak increases.

If the daily goal is not achieved, the current streak resets.

The program also records the longest streak achieved during the tracking period.

Longest Goal Streak : X Day(s)

This demonstrates the practical use of:

- Counters.
- Conditional statements.
- Loops.
- Running values.
- Comparisons.
- Historical tracking.

---

🧮 Core Calculations

The project uses several calculations throughout its development.

Distance

Kilometres = Steps ÷ 1,250

Base Calories

Calories = (Steps ÷ 1,000) × 40

Goal Progress

Progress = (Today's Steps ÷ Daily Goal) × 100

Average Steps

Average Steps = Total Steps ÷ Number of Days

Average Distance

Average Distance = Total Distance ÷ Number of Days

Average Calories

Average Calories = Total Calories ÷ Number of Days

The Grade A version additionally adjusts the calorie estimate according to activity intensity.
